# nrac : The *New* RapidASM Compiler

After making a lot of incorrect decisions in the implementation of my original
compiler for RapidASM, and after finding a few problems with the design of the
language as a whole, I have elected to rewrite it from scratch, but still in
Java as there's nothing wrong with using it for a compiler and ANTLR has really
nice Maven tooling for Java anyways.

You can find the original [here](https://github.com/treyzania/RapidASM-compiler).
